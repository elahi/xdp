## Before Class 

### `R` and `RStudio`

Before the first class please read through the [computer setup instructions](https://elahi.github.io/00-setup-R.html) that walk you through how to set up your computer to run R and Rstudio. Even if you have these programs already installed, make sure to check that you are running the latest versions of R and RStudio (which the instructions will tell you how to do). 

## Week 1
