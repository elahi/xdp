**os3** refers to the Open Intro stats book. Supplemental readings are described below. 

## Before Class 

### `R` and `RStudio`

Before the first class please read through the [computer setup instructions](https://elahi.github.io/00-setup-R.html) that walk you through how to set up your computer to run R and Rstudio. Even if you have these programs already installed, make sure to check that you are running the latest versions of R and RStudio (which the instructions will tell you how to do). 

## Week 1

### Monday

- [Introduction to course](slides/course_intro.pdf) 
- [Data collection](slides/data_collection.pdf)
- [Mussel measurements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dh0-o0Ot6VsAXBCFV4VzEOrx538wM92Va2DjYhPoLA0/edit#gid=0)

*Prep for Wednesday*  
Install R and Rstudio on your computer (if you haven't already!), and read the following website:  
https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/00-before-we-start.html

When you get to the part about the working directory - create a new folder on your desktop called `biohopk-174`.  We will work from within this folder on Wednesday. In this folder, create an Rstudio project (`biohopk-174.Rproj`), as well as the following folders:

  - data
  - data_output
  - docs
  - figs
  - scripts
  
*If you are having trouble installing RStudio please seek help from Robin or Nicole*

### Wednesday

[Intro to R and Rstudio](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html)

The first assignment is [here](oiLabs-elahi/intro_to_r/intro_to_r.pdf). I suggest that you work through the material first in a plain R script (file name ends with `.R`). Once you are comfortable with the basics of plotting from vectors within a dataframe, then write up the answers to the questions in an `.Rmd` file. A tutorial on using .Rmd files is [here](https://elahi.github.io/01-B-Rmarkdown-intro.html), and we'll get some practice using `.Rmd` files next Monday. 

## Week 2
### Monday

- Quiz 1
- Finish up data collection
- Examining numerical and categorical data; data viz

### Wednesday

- Examining numerical and categorical data; data viz
- In advance of class, please read and work through:
    - https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html

- The second assignment is [here](oiLabs-elahi/intro_to_data/intro_to_data.pdf), and due in one week. 

## Week 3
### Monday

- Quiz 2
- Introduction to probability

### Wednesday

- Conditional probability, Bayes theorem, and Bayesian inference
- The third assignment is [here](oiLabs-elahi/probability/probability.html), and due in one week. 
    - Note that I've added some tips on how to format your Rmd file so that the resulting word document is easy to read:
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elahi/xdp/master/oiLabs-elahi/rmd_hw_tips/rmd_hw_tips.Rmd
    - You can see the rendered word file [here](oiLabs-elahi/rmd_hw_tips/rmd_hw_tips.docx)
    - As further examples, I've posted the .Rmd file and the corresponding word output for the first assignment (birth_records_xxx) in the github repository [here](https://github.com/elahi/xdp/tree/master/oiLabs-elahi/intro_to_r)

## Week 4

### Monday

- Quiz 3
- The normal distribution
- Practice with the normal distribution in R [here](oiLabs-elahi/normal_distribution/normal_distribution.html)

### Wednesday

- Probability distributions, sampling distributions and the central limit theorem
- The fourth assignment is [here](oiLabs-elahi/sampling_distributions/sampling_distributions.html), and due in one week.
